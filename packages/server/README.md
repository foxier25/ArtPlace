# ArtPlace Server

## Overview
This is a GraphQL server that allows you to define and run queries against a data model. It uses the Apollo Server framework and Node.js, along with TypeScript for type checking and Express for HTTP server. With GraphQL, you can specify exactly what data you need, which reduces the amount of data transferred over the network and improves performance. This server supports multiple modules, with separate schema and resolvers for each module. It also includes support for subscriptions, allowing you to receive real-time updates when the underlying data changes.
